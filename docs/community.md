# Public meetings

Every two weeks, we have a contributors call meeting.

Every three weeks, we have two planning calls:

  - \`\`Sprint Planning Preparation and Issue Triage'' - on Monday

  - \`\`Sprint Planning'' - on Wednesday

You can find the exact dates of all scheduled odo calls together with
sprint dates in the [odo
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gi0s0v5ukfqkjpnn26p6va3jfc%40group.calendar.google.com).

To automatically get invites to the calls, add yourself to the [odo-dev
Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/odo-dev).

# Contributing

## Where do I start?

odo is a complex project that touches both Kubernetes and OpenShift. We
have a list of [good first
issues](https://github.com/openshift/odo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
to help start.

## How do I contribute code?

Want to submit your code? Have a look at our [development
guide](https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/docs/dev/development.adoc).
It goes over every aspect from submitting to writing tests.
